/* Question 16.3
 
In the famous dining philosophers problem, a bunch of philosophers are sitting around a circular table 
with one chopstick between each of them. A philosopher needs both chopsticks to eat, and always picks 
up the left chopstick before the right on. A deadlock could potentially occur if all the philosophers 
reached for the left chopstick at the same time. Using threads and locks, implement a simlation of the 
dining philosophers problem that prevents deadlocks.
