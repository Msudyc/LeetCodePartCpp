/* Question 13.8
 
Write a smart pointer class. A smart pointer is a data type, usually implemented with templates, 
that simulates a pointer while also providing automatic garbage collection. It automatically counts
the number of references to a SmartPointer<T*> object and frees the object of type T when the 
reference count hits zero.
