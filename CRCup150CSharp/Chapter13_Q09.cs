/* Question 13.9
 
Write an aligned malloc and free function that supports allocating memory such that the memory
address returned is divisible by a specific power of two.
 * 
Example
align_malloc(1000, 128) will return a memory address that is multiple of 128 and 
that points to memory of size 1000 bytes.
 
aligned_free() will free memory allocated by align_malloc.
